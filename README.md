Dahak is a software suite that integrates state-of-the-art open source tools for metagenomic analyses. Tools in the dahak software suite will perform various steps in metagenomic analysis workflows including data pre-processing, metagenome assembly, taxonomic and functional classification, genome binning, and gene assignment. We aim to deliver the analytical framework as a robust and reliable containerized workflow system, which will be free from dependency, installation, and execution problems typically associated with other open-source bioinformatics solutions. This will maximize the transparency, data provenance (i.e., the process of tracing the origins of data and its movement through the workflow), and reproducibility.

## Getting Started

Analyis protocols can be found in the [workflows](https://github.com/dahak-metagenomics/dahak/tree/master/workflows) directory. It is assumed that analysis will begin with read filtering instrcutions for Docker installation are included there. 

## Prerequisites

It is assumed that all steps will be executed in an Ubuntu 16.04 image.
